a robot making music and sharing it with the world

###What?

tuneb0t takes random loops from directories and combines them together with correct 4/4 musical phrasing to produce a dynamic song. The larger your loop directory, the more random the resulting mp3 (obviously)

The output audio is then given a randomly generated name, uploaded to a SoundCloud account along with a random image pulled from the Flickr API and 'glitched' using The Art & Science of Whatever's Image Glitch script.

Once the upload is complete tuneb0t will send a tweet via the twitter API containing the URL of the uploaded SoundCloud file.


###Uses?

Enjoy an endless supply of randomly generated songs
